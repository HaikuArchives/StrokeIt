Description (from first commit):  
> This is the initial check in of my old BeOS R5 PDA input driver (with provisional fix for Dano R5.1 input server.)
> 
> The code is basically an input server filter driver that interprets data from the user and translates it in to key
> presses.
> 
> This version has NEVER been compiled and is the amalgamation of the PowerPC and Intel R5.03 version with the Dano
> fix I came up with to work around the major mouse tracking bug in the Input Server.
